## Hardware
### Parts List
Frame: [DJI Flamewheel F450](https://docs.px4.io/en/frames_multicopter/dji_flamewheel_450.html) ($230)

Controller: [Pixracer](https://docs.px4.io/en/flight_controller/pixracer.html) ($99)

## Wiring Instruction
There are specs and examples online showing the detailed wiring instruction.

According to PX4 website, it's possible to control Blade 130X helicopter using pixhawk. However, considering the size of the helicopter is not capable of extra sensors or cameras, I decided not to use that.
