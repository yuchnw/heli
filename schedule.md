# Schedules

## Objective
The goal of this project is to accomlish mapping, localization and planning for a toy helicopter.

#
## Milestone 1
Connect the RC helicopter to computer and be able to control it using keyboard.

## Milestone 2
Apply path planning algorithm to it and let it be able to fly along desired trajectory, at correct speed.

## Milestone 3
Learn about Kalman Filter, Particle Filter and other algorithms that are used for SLAM.

#

## Milestone 4
Mount distance sensors and GPS to it and perform localization.

## Milestone 5
Mount camera and detect signs to control the helicopter.
